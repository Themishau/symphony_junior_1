Junior_Task Diary

explanation: 
This is a diary to show my process regarding the JUNIOR_TASK given to me. I also include the ideas and reasons behind which OS, IDE and so on I use. 
Nevertheless, I am also influenced by the side notes and information givin by Dirk.

The amount of preparation for this task might be a little 'overkill' but it is how I would like to structure and prepare a project. 
I am now used to structure my project to add additional projects / and continue to work on this project on any other workstation/pc.

Dirk told me about saving code not at the 'host server', but for this project it is ok, to do it. He also talked about 'makefiles', which I used before for some other projects. 
For sure, I am not able to ignore this information and did some research on saving data not a the local host server. 

This Diary might be hard to read, but shows how I work. 
I do not have any experience with docker or Fedora Linux which I am using.



pseudo makefile:

PORT?=8082

.PHONY: start
start:
	docker build -t my-php-apache .
	docker run --name apache -d -p $(PORT):80 --mount type=bind,source="$(CURDIR)"/htdocs,target=/var/www/html my-php-apache

.PHONY: stop
stop:
	docker stop apache
	docker rm apache

.PHONY: logs
logs:
	docker container logs apache

.PHONY: login
login:
	docker exec -it apache bash

.PHONY: status
status:
	docker ps -f name=apache


dockerfile: 

FROM php:apache
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
RUN ln -s ../mods-available/{expires,headers,rewrite}.load /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/
RUN sed -e '/<Directory \/var\/www\/>/,/<\/Directory>/s/AllowOverride None/AllowOverride All/' -i /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
COPY php.ini /usr/local/etc/php/

To use this setup, you would:

    Create a Dockerfile in your project directory with the content provided above.
    Create a Makefile in your project directory with the content provided above.
    Run make start to build and start your Docker container.
    Access your application at http://localhost:8082/ (or whatever port you specified).


Project Structure: 
/my-project
    Dockerfile
    Makefile
    /src
        /app
            index.php
            /css
            /js
        /config
            php.ini
            .htaccess
    /tests
        /unit
        /integration

create a backend with symphony 
-> how to create a symphony project? 
-> the first thing I found beside the documentation on the official site 
   was here https://dev.to/hantsy/-building-restful-apis-with-symfony-5-and-php-8-1p2e 
   -> It as too much information, but I focused on some keywords like symphony controller, creating templates/skeletons, factory? to create a new post instance?
   -> I do not use any database so doctrine is useless for me now

-> because I have to build three functions which compute things and the output is goal I want to do it based on Tests. TDD? 
-> How can I test it? There seem to be a Framework PHPUnit, which is also used by Symphony. 

# php bin/console make:test

do it in folder!
sudo usermod -aG docker mz
newgrp docker
sudo systemctl status docker -- check if everything is ok
sudo systemctl restart docker
su mz -- it helped here

IN VS CODE TERMINAL / FOLDER 

Run ' make build ' to build your Docker image.
Run ' make start ' to start your Docker container.

I assume that the version in makefile is not supported yet by apache -> not working
Delete installed php version on fedora? 

i dont know how to fix it

i create a new symphony project

composer create-project symfony/skeleton junior-task


I had some namespace problems. It was caused by wrong path


https://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices.html#fetching-services


        // add the results of computed sequences in an array
        return array_push($this->calculateFibonacciSequence(($size - 1)), $size);

        does not seem to work. save it in variable instead 

https://symfony.com/bundles/NelmioApiDocBundle/current/index.html for later :)
